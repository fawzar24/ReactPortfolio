                <p>I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a background in BioChemistry but found Joy in programing and writing applications that affect and improve peopleâ€™s lives. I currently work at Apple as Technical Specialist providing hardware/software support to customers, but I recently decided to earn a Full stack Developer certification from the University of Minnesota.

                    I Effectively combined my creativity and problem solving skills to develop user-friendly applications. I worked with my teammates on projects to develop working and user friendly application with limited time, testing our ingenuity, and effective communication skills.  

                    In my off time I love watching the NBA, working out, and spending time with my family. </p>
